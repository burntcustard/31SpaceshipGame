//=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-//

In-Progress:
  Asteroids(Sorry, "Rocks") - Kinda done
  Colour layering - Burnt

To-do:
  Stop FPS bugging on level reload <-- This because you were loading another level ON TOP :D
  Weapon stuff
  Enemy ships
  Hit point stuff
  Move ships with velocity rather than impulse
  Level constructor (and level changing?)

Done:
  Better level object
  Ship movement and tilting
  Change ships - need a more graceful method for when level changes work
  Entity objects and ship/rock sub types (inheritance yay!)
  Keyboard stuff

// -------------------- IDEAS / PLANNING -------------------- //
//=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-//

Main game:

  Ship can move left and right at bottom of screen.
    - When you hit left or right, x velocity is applied immediatley, and when xv > 0 or < 0
      the sprite changes to going left or right, giving player instand feedback, as well as
      making the ship a teeny tiny bit thinner so could be used to dodge incoming projectiles.

  Aim is to last the level by avoiding (and/or) shooting asteroids out of your way.

  Different weapons with different fire rates (and projectiles and explosions :D )

  Enemy ships as well as asteroids. (They would move around screen like asteroids and also shoot)
    - Big(ish) or 2 or 3 enemies as bosses!

  Player has number of hit-points equalling the number of secondary colour "cockpit" pixels they
  have left. As much as possible, every weapon or collision must do 1 point of damage (but could
  have different rates of fire, splash damage radius, projectile velocity).


Visual Extras:

  When the level is complete the ship could 'boost' up the screen with a big nice engine blast.

  Need some kind of star-field in the background to show the movement (could use paralax?)
    - "Stars" (pixels with little trails) with random y velocities?

  Primary/secondary colours on ships using coloured overlays.

  Grey-scale values for black'n'white images that will have colour put over the top:
  255, 192, 128, 80, 32

  Do engine trails separately to rest of ship so can be animated etc.

Input:

  Have a 'key' object containing all keys used for the game
  When a key is pressed the time-stamp is stored under the correct name - Not using now
  This allows for accurate cool downs on keys (check that now - keyTimestamp > than cooldown)
