Main game:
  Ship can move left and right at bottom of screen
  Aim is to last the level by avoiding (and/or) shooting asteroids out of your way
  Different weapons with different fire rates (and projectiles and explosions :D )
  Enemy ships as well as asteroids. (They would move around screen like asteroids and also shoot)
    - Big(ish) or 2 or 3 enemies as bosses!
  
Visual Extras:
  When the level is complete the ship could 'boost' up the screen with a big nice engine blast
  Need some kind of starfield in the background to show the movement (could use paralax?)
    - "Stars" (pixels with little trails) with random y velocities?
  Primary/secondary colours on ships using coloured overlays
